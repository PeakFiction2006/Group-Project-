                    <p>
                        To see to it that everyone under our services is safe from digital espionage. 
                        So that the hardwork of our clients isn't stolen from under their nose. No matter 
                        from whom, how or when they can be assured that their secrets are safe with us.

                <section>
                    <h4>Basics</h4>
                    <p>
                    We begin by having all client-employee devices installed with our company designed 
                    antivirus, firewall, vpn and antimalware. Then all devices are run through a thorough scan 
                    to ensure any current hacks that occur before our companie employ are patched before proceeding.
                    When we are assured that all the devices in use by the company are secure we set up 4 factor 
                    authentication to access them and serverside files of the company. 
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Digital Habit Building and Policy</h4>
                    We coach the employees on proper digital hygiene habits. For instances, any urls outside of those neccessary to work on
                    company devices will be blocked without prejudice. Any non-secure wifi connections are denied without prejudice. 
                    All these habits will be codified into policy upon discussion with firm leadership.

                    <h4>Physical Training</h4>
                    Many leaks of data are caused by physical espionage where access or info to access is unwittingly 
                    handed over to competitors or the like. For instance we retrain employeess regularly not to 
                    answer sensitive questions to those without given clearance. Such trainings ensure while the server is secure, 
                    no one other than those in the company can access the server at all.

                <section>
                    <h4>Server Management</h4>
                    We have dedicated staff who will manage the server 24/7. 
                    We also employee ethical hackers(aka white hackers) to test
                    server defenses at every end of the month. Once a leak is identified
                    it is reported and patched in an instant.

                <section>
                    <h4>Physical Testing</h4>
                    Our staff will attempt to test staff on leaks through calls, social media or physical contact. 
                    The goal is to see if staff need retraining against physical leak of server access. 
                    If it is deemed that the employee evaluation in their training is lacking, the company 
                    is forced to undergo retraining by our specialists to prevent further issues.
