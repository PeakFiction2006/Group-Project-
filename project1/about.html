                    the standard means of protection like VPN's, antivirus, firewall, etc. Especially when such<br>
                    sensitive data needs to be safeguarded from competitors. Thus his joint contribution to the firm<br>

                     Matthew Yeo is an alumni at Swinburne University of Technology. He graduated in the year 2002, <br>
                     leaving with a bachelors in computer science majoring in cyber security. He worked an<br>

                     for them under a full time position as Senior Cyber Intelligence Analyst.<br>
                      <br>
                        Matthew worked as a white-hacker for years and has been active in the competitive  <br>
                        hacking community during that time.He has been up to date to all past and recent  <br>
                        developments in the hacking scene. Thus has an intimate knowledgewith any tricks <br>
                        that needs precautions against. <br> 
                     <br>
                    During his years working in the industry he reached a single conclusion: cyber criminals   <br>
                    are getting smarter, and the industry is not fully caught up. The founding of the firm <br>
                    for Matthew was to fill in this gap for a price at excellent service by experienced persons.

                    Marcus Au is an alumni at Swinburne University of Technology. He graduated in the year 2001, <br>
                    leaving with a bachelors in computer science majoring in IT. He worked an<br>
                    internship position at Apple security development division for 1 year. <br>
                     <br>
                    Marcus has been an IT manager for Black Rock for the past 4 years. <br>
                    Later on he transitioned to being a consultant to prevent data leaks. <br>
                    Wherein he was in charge with setting up policy to safeguard the <br>
                    firms highly sensitive data. Under his purview no leaks have occured <br>
                    under Black Rock Asset Management. <br>
                      <br>
                    In his experience, the worst way data is leaked was because of human error giving the         <br>
                    hackers an in. Without proper proper protocols, according to Marcus, the data will find <br>
                    its way out of a firm into the hands of competitors through coorparate espionage or gossip.
