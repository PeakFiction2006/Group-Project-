                    <h3 class="bio_lachlan">Biography</h3>
                    <p class="bio_lachlan">
                     Lachlan Philips is an alumni at Swinburne University of Technology. He graduated in the year 2000, <br>
                     leaving with a bachelors in computer science majoring in software development. He worked an<br>
                     internship with Boring Software IT Labs in Sydney for 2 years. Afterwards, leaving to join <br>
                     Microsoft in their Research & Development(R&D) for systems security.<br>
                     <br>
                    Lachlan has multiple years of experience in IT as a software developer for Microsoft. <br>
                    He specifically worked in their cybersecurity division as a consultant and contractor.<br>
                    During that stint he had a big hand in shaping their systems protections.<br>
                    Afterward he developed the protection softwares used by the firm currently.<br>
                        <br>
                    Lachlan Philips sincerely believes that protection of firms data ought not be relied on through   <br>
                    the standard means of protection like VPN's, antivirus, firewall, etc. Especially when such<br>
                    sensitive data needs to be safeguarded from competitors. Thus his joint contribution to the firm<br>
                    has been the continued improvement and development of protection software and services to clients. <br>
                      <br>
                    Currently Lachlan is in charge of our Digital Protections division. He manages the research and <br>
                    development of protections software, while also conducting scans and tests of client servers for <br>
                    leaks. As of late he leads a team of 20 in doing this work. <br>

                    <p class="bio_matthew">
                     Matthew Yeo is an alumni at Swinburne University of Technology. He graduated in the year 2002, <br>
                     leaving with a bachelors in computer science majoring in cyber security. He worked an<br>
                     internship at IBM cybersecurity division in Perth for a year. Afterwards eventually working <br>
                     for them under a full time position as Senior Cyber Intelligence Analyst.<br>
                      <br>
                        Matthew worked as a white-hacker for years and has been active in the competitive  <br>
                        hacking community during that time.He has been up to date to all past and recent  <br>
                        developments in the hacking scene. Thus has an intimate knowledgewith any tricks <br>
                        that needs precautions against. <br> 
                     <br>
                    During his years working in the industry he reached a single conclusion: cyber criminals   <br>
                    are getting smarter, and the industry is not fully caught up. The founding of the firm <br>
                    for Matthew was to fill in this gap for a price at excellent service by experienced persons.<br>
                    <br>
                    Matthew took charge of the People Protections division of the firm. Many hacking leaks begin with <br>
                    the exploitation of human error in revealing info to hackers and their collaborators unwittingly. <br>
                    Therefore it is the People Protections division's job to retrain the client employees against any form<br>
                    of Social-Hacking. While also letting them know of past and current tricks hackers have created to <br>
                    obtain access through them directly. <br>

                    <h3 class="bio_marcus">Biography</h3>
                    <p class="bio_marcus">
                    Marcus Au is an alumni at Swinburne University of Technology. He graduated in the year 2001, <br>
                    leaving with a bachelors in computer science majoring in IT. He worked an<br>
                    internship position at Apple security development division for 1 year. <br>
                     <br>
                    Marcus has been an IT manager for Black Rock for the past 4 years. <br>
                    Later on he transitioned to being a consultant to prevent data leaks. <br>
                    Wherein he was in charge with setting up policy to safeguard the <br>
                    firms highly sensitive data. Under his purview no leaks have occured <br>
                    under Black Rock Asset Management. <br>
                      <br>
                    In his experience, the worst way data is leaked was because of human error giving the <br>
                    hackers an in. Without proper proper protocols, according to Marcus, the data will find <br>
                    its way out of a firm into the hands of competitors through coorparate espionage or gossip. <br>
                    <br>
                    Marcus is the leader of the Physical Protections dividion of the firm. The Physical Protections      <br>
                    divion is charged with setting protocol for devices linked to comapany servers, while also managing<br>
                    a heirarchy access to info within the company. These protocols he developed at his time in Black Rock<br>
                    are still implemented there today. However there is no one size fits all for protocols, therefore he <br>
                    services as a consultant on these matters when setting up policy.<br>
